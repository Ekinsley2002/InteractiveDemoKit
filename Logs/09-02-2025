Newest Addition Notes:


Problems in nav:
PP->Spring->AFM->Haptic (haptic doesn't work) (Slighltly fixed) (Commit #1)


Bugs to fix:
Adders in haptic feedback values are not centered vertically.

Haptic feedback working at all with buttons?


Critical:
Send parameters is not constant and can cause the program to crash. (Especially going from afm to spring) X

Spring Dampener will go all the way back to the zero point. This is dangerous if users spin the motor in haptic then go to Spring Dampener. 

Quality upgrades:
Make clear prev trial button/add to layout

Make Zero line stay at zero in afm

Find better data storage for afm/topology

Transition for haptic

Transition for spring dampener

If possible make gear in main menu less glitchy

Make power pong nicer

add simple tutorials

add animation for some buttons like FORE!

(I like the idea of audio cues to make it nicer)

X = Under construction
V = Finished
